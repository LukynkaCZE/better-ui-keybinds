## Keybinds

There are currently the following keybinds:

- **__Main Menu__**
  - `S` to open the World Selection Screen
  - `M` to open the Server Selection Screen
  - `MM` to join the first server in your server list
- **__World Selection Screen__**
  - _Searchbox is automatically selected when opening screen so you can start typing immidiately_
  - `Enter` to join the top-most world on the search list
- **__Server Selection Screen__**
  - `M` to join the first server in the server list
  - `A` to add new server
  - `D` to open the direct connect screen
  - `1-9` to join the corresponding server in the server list
- **__Server Disconnect Screen__**
  - `ESC` to return to Server Selection Screen
- **__Creative Menu__**
  - `Tab` to automatically switch to the search page and automatically select textbox
  - `Tab` when you have the textbox selected to clear it

Im open to suggestions for more keybinds! You can join [my discord]([https://discord.gg/SA9nmfMkdc](https://discord.gg/SA9nmfMkdc)) or [open an issue](https://github.com/LukynkaCZE/better-ui-keybinds/issues) on github.

## Why can't I rebind these keys in controls?

This mod does not use the minecraft keybinding system to prevent conflicts (ex. `S` to open world selection screen would block movement backwards)
